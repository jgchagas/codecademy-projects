      <h2>Going to a Fashion Show</h2>
      <p>Fashion Weeks can be both amazingly fun and incredibly overwhelming, especially if you are a novice.
        Lucky
        for
        you, darling, I am here to give an
        insider's guide and make your debut a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and
        following
        your
        gut, you MUST HAVE
        an unforgettable experience!</p>

      <p>If you are lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag, darling. But if you don't have
        those
        superpowers,
        I can help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule. And this
        is a
        MUST HAVE: a budget.
        If you are worryied about blowing your cash the whole time you will not be able to enjoy yourself.hThen
        check
        out prices, days, and times,
        and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>

      <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, unless it requires a cape! You don't want to be uncomfortable
        the
        whole time and it will show.
        Remember, fashion is about expressing yourself! It is also important to wear shoes that will be
        comfortable
        all
        day long. Obviously you want to look
        good, but consider you will be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
